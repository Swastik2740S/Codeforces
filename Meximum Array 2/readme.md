Hi, I'm Swastik 👋
I'm a Computer Science student at Chitkara University with a focus on building scalable, user-centric software. I enjoy solving problems, designing systems, and turning ideas into working products.

What I've Been Working On
I recently won HackIndia 2024 (1st among 2839 teams) with a Web3 carbon credit marketplace built on Ethereum. Before that, I finished Top 3 at Hackfest 2024 in Coimbatore with the first prototype of the same idea.

Most of my recent work involves full-stack development with Spring Boot, Next.js, and blockchain technologies. I'm comfortable moving between backend services, frontend interfaces, and deployment pipelines.

Current Focus
Right now I'm spending time on:

Building production-ready applications with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL
Exploring Web3 and smart contract development with Solidity
Strengthening my problem-solving skills (200+ problems on LeetCode)
Contributing to open source and maintaining active projects
Technical Experience
Backend & APIs: Spring Boot, Express.js, REST APIs, JWT authentication, role-based access control

Frontend: React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS

Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Prisma ORM

Blockchain: Solidity, Web3.js, MetaMask integration, ERC-20 tokens

Infrastructure: Docker, AWS EC2, Linux CLI, Git

Languages: Java, JavaScript

Notable Projects
Green Credit Marketplace — National hackathon winner. A Web3 platform for trading carbon credits with Solidity smart contracts, IPFS storage, and MetaMask authentication. Deployed on Render with Docker.

SmartTask — Task management system with Spring Boot 3.5, Next.js, and PostgreSQL. Role-based access, JWT auth, Swagger docs, deployed on AWS EC2.

Employee Management System — Full-stack HR platform with session auth, role-based permissions, timesheet validation, and payroll tracking. Maintained for 4+ months with regular updates.

Get in Touch
I'm always open to discussing ideas, collaborating on projects, or just having a conversation about technology.
